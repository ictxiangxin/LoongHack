%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
appear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
# assumes Orb of Detection (glass object)
%Cc Arc 00082
"Careful, %p!  %oC might break, and that would be
a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your
return through the magic portal that brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E

%Cc Bar 00001
Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can %x the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, should %l be there?

Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
evil magic in the air.

Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:

    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
%E
%Cp Bar 00002
Once again, you near %H.  You know that %l
will be waiting.
%E
%Cp Bar 00003
Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
%H.
%E
%Cp Bar 00005
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00006
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00007
"There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
%E
%Cp Bar 00008
"The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
%E
%Cp Bar 00009
"%lC is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."
%E
%Cp Bar 00010
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00011
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00012
"Times will be good again, now that the horde is vanquished."
%E
%Cp Bar 00013
"You have brought our clan much honor in defeating %n."
%E
%Cp Bar 00014
"You will be a worthy successor to %l."
%E
%Cc Bar 00015
"Ah, %p.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.

"But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."
%E
%Cp Bar 00016
"%p, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00017
"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
%E
%Cc Bar 00018
"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain
the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
closed that future to you.

"I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome
me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
%E
%Cc Bar 00019
"%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
%n.  Only %Ra with the help of %d could ever hope to
defeat him."
%E
%Cc Bar 00020
"%pC!  You have wandered from the path of the %a!
If you attempt to overcome %n in this state, he will surely
enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
Go forth, and return when you feel ready."
%E
%Cc Bar 00021
"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about him.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

"You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down
%n, defeat him, and return %o to us.  Only
then will the world be safe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00025
"%nC is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
%E
%Cp Bar 00026
"Remember that %n is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
of Atlantis."
%E
%Cp Bar 00027
"If you fail, %p, I will not be able to protect these people long."
%E
%Cp Bar 00028
"To enter %i, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
guard."
%E
%Cp Bar 00029
"Call upon %d in your time of need."
%E
%Cp Bar 00030
"May %d protect you, and guide your steps."
%E
%Cp Bar 00031
"If you can lay hands upon %o, carry it for good fortune."
%E
%Cp Bar 00032
"I cannot stand against %ns sorcery.  But %d will help you."
%E
%Cp Bar 00033
"Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat him."
%E
%Cp Bar 00034
"You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat
%n."
%E
%Cc Bar 00035
The scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
you have located %i.
%E
%Cp Bar 00036
Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
%E
%Cc Bar 00040
The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of %n.
%E
%Cp Bar 00041
Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.
%E
%Cc Bar 00050
"So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer %l sends to do his bidding.
I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.

"Prepare to die, %c."
%E
%Cp Bar 00051
"I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00052
"You return yet again, %c!  Are you prepared for death now?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00053
"I shall have %o back, you pitiful excuse for %ca.
And your life as well."
%E
%Cp Bar 00060
"My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00061
"You are a sorry excuse for %ra."
%E
%Cp Bar 00062
"Run while you can, %c.  My next spell will be your last."
%E
%Cp Bar 00063
"I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
%E
%Cp Bar 00064
"%d cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00065
"Your %a nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Bar 00066
"Come, %c.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00067
"Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off %l, and your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00068
"Fight, %c, or are you afraid of the mighty %n?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00069
"You have failed, %c.  Now, my victory is complete."
%E
%Cc Bar 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the power of it
flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
at once, even though you are holding it.
%E
%Cc Bar 00080
%nC falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
begun to fade.
%E
%Cc Bar 00081
When %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.

    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in
    your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
    quest far greater than you realize.

    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
    time comes.
%E
%Cc Bar 00082
%l gazes reverently at %o, then back at you.

"You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
for the Amulet.  %Z await your return through the
magic portal which brought you here."
%E
%Cp Bar 00090
"Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
%E
%Cc Bar 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E

%Cc Cav 00001
You descend through a barely familiar stairwell that you remember
%l showing you when you embarked upon your vision quest.

You arrive back at %H, but something seems
wrong here.  The usual smoke and glowing light of the fires of the
outer caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.
%E
%Cp Cav 00002
Once again, you arrive back at %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00003
For some reason, you think that this may be the last time you will
enter %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00005
"We have not been able to gather as much food since the Giants sealed
off our access to the outer world."
%E
%Cp Cav 00006
"Since %n sent her minions, we have been constantly fighting."
%E
%Cp Cav 00007
"I have heard your vision quest was successful.  Is this so?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00008
"So, tell me, %p, how have you fared?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00009
"%lC grows old.  We know not who will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cp Cav 00010
"The rains have returned and the land grows lush again."
%E
%Cp Cav 00011
"Peace has returned, give thanks to %d!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00012
"Welcome back!  Did you find %o?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00013
"So, %p, tell us the story of your fight with %n."
%E
%Cp Cav 00014
"%lC grows old.  Perhaps you will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cc Cav 00015
"You have returned from your vision quest, %p.  Thank %d.

"We are in dire need of your help, my %S.

"But first, I must see if you are yet capable of the quest I would
ask you to undertake."
%E
%Cp Cav 00016
"Again, you return to us, %p.  Let me see if you are ready now."
%E
%Cp Cav 00017
"Ah, %p.  Are you finally ready?"
%E
%Cc Cav 00018
"%pC!  You have sealed our fate by being unable to reform yourself.

"Begone from %H!  You have betrayed us by choosing
the path of the %C over the true path of the %L.

"You no longer live in our eyes."
%E
%Cc Cav 00019
"Alas, %p, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.

"%rA could not possibly survive the rigors demanded to find
%i, never mind to confront %n herself.

"Adventure some more, and you will learn the skills you will require.
%d decrees it."
%E
%Cc Cav 00020
"%pC!  You have deviated from my teachings.  You no longer follow
the path of the %a as you should.  I banish you from these caves, to
go forth and purify yourself.  Then, you might be able to accomplish this
quest."
%E
%Cc Cav 00021
"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our caves safe once more.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."
%E
%Cp Cav 00025
"%nC is immune to her own breath weapons.
You should use magic upon her that she does not use herself."
%E
%Cp Cav 00026
"When you encounter %n, call upon %d for assistance."
%E
%Cp Cav 00027
"There will be nowhere to hide inside %ns inner sanctum."
%E
%Cp Cav 00028
"Your best chance with %n will be to keep moving."
%E
%Cp Cav 00029
"Do not be distracted by the great treasures in %ns lair.
Concentrate on %o."
%E
%Cp Cav 00030
"%oC is the only object that %n truly fears."
%E
%Cp Cav 00031
"Do not be fooled by %ns size.  She is fast, and it is
rumored that she uses magic."
%E
%Cp Cav 00032
"I would send a party of %gP with you, but we will need all
of our strength to defend ourselves."
%E
%Cp Cav 00033
"Remember, be %a at all times.  This is your strength."
%E
%Cp Cav 00034
"If only we had an amulet of reflection, this would not have happened."
%E
%Cc Cav 00035
You %x many large claw marks on the ground.  The tunnels ahead
of you are larger than most of those in any cave complex you have
ever been in before.

Your nose detects the smell of carrion from within, and bones litter
the sides of the tunnels.
%E
%Cp Cav 00036
Once again, you approach %i.
%E
%Cc Cav 00040
You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that
nevertheless show signs of being scorched by fire.

Bones litter the floor, and there are objects scattered everywhere.
The air is close with the stench of sulphurous fumes.

%nC is clearly visible, but she seems to be asleep.
%E
%Cp Cav 00041
Once again, you find yourself in the lair of %n.
%E
%Cc Cav 00050
"So, follower of %l, you seek to invade the lair of %n.
Only my meals are allowed down here.  Prepare to be eaten!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00051
"So, again you face me, %c.  No one has ever before escaped me.
Now I shall kill you."
%E
%Cp Cav 00052
"You are getting annoying, %c.  Prepare to die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00053
"I'll have %o from you, %c.  You shall die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00060
"You are weak, %c.  No challenge for the Mother of all Dragons."
%E
%Cp Cav 00061
"I grow hungry, %r.  You look like a nice appetizer!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00062
"Join me for lunch?  You're the main course, %c."
%E
%Cp Cav 00063
"With %o, I am invincible!  You cannot succeed."
%E
%Cp Cav 00064
"Your mentor, %l has failed.  You are nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Cav 00065
"You shall die here, %c.  %rA cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00066
"You, a mere %r challenge the might of %n?  Hah!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00067
"I am the Mother of all Dragons!  You cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00068
"My claws are sharp now.  I shall rip you to shreds!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00069
"%d has deserted you, %c.  This is my domain."
%E
%Cc Cav 00070
As you pick up %o it seems heavy at first, but as you
hold it strength flows into your arms.

You suddenly feel full of power, as if nothing could possibly stand
in your path.

    A short while ago, the dreaded %nt was fooled by the gods
    into thinking that he could use %o to find a

    He has exhausted his own supply of healthy people and now he seeks to
    extend his influence into our world.  You must recover from him

    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the

"Yes, %p, you truly are ready for this dire task.  Listen,

without it, I have but a shadow of my former power, and I fear that I

Tutorial: Welcome

Welcome to DynaHack!  These tutorial messages will help you learn how
to play the game.  To view any of these messages again, enter the help
menu by pressing the ? key.

The screen shows game messages at the top, the map in the middle,
character info at the top and inventory to the right

Each symbol represents something; you are the @ sign.  Generally,
letters (and some symbols like ' : ; & and @) are creatures, and
punctuation marks are dungeon features (like - and | for walls, and .
for floor) or items (like $ for gold).  You can press / to ask what a
symbol means, or ; to describe something on the map.

Now press space to close this, then ; to look around.

Tutorial: Pets

You enter the dungeon with a tame kitten (f), little dog (d) or pony
(u), which follows you and fights monsters with you.

Your pet will mostly take care of itself, eating corpses when hungry
and avoiding fights it thinks it will lose.  With practice, it may
grow larger and stronger.  It may start off better at combat than
weaker characters; keep it close if you're inexperienced.

Your pet can only follow you up or down stairs if it is next to you,
otherwise it may be stranded and in time grow wild.

If you don't know what to do next, use the cursor movement keys to
move, or use ; to look at other things around you.
%E
%Cm - 00211
Tutorial: Monsters

That's a hostile monster, one of many threats in the Mazes of Menace.
Be careful in dark corridors; monsters are only shown if you can see
them!

You can run away from monsters, though this can leave you backed into
a corner, and if it's faster than you it will catch up and attack you.
More often you'll want to kill the monster, by fighting it up close
('in melee'), using missiles and casting spells.

Now try fighting this monster by walking into it with the cursor
movement keys (even diagonally)!
%E
%Cm - 00212
Tutorial: Peaceful Monsters and Alignment

Not all monsters will try to kill you on sight; such monsters are
referred to as 'peaceful'.  However, accidentally hurting them will
anger them, and they can be very dangerous when angry, so they're
often best left alone.  If one blocks your path, wait a few turns for
them to move out of your way (press . to wait).  You can also chat to
them (press c) for various effects, shown at the top of the screen.

The biggest factor of how monsters react to you is alignment (Lawful,
Neutral or Chaotic); monsters who share your alignment are more likely
to be peaceful.  You can see your alignment at the bottom of the
screen.  You can also see alignment, as well as your religion, by
pressing Ctrl-X (each alignment has a god).

         .    wait a turn
         c    chat to monster (also #chat)
    Ctrl-X    view character info (e.g. alignment, god)

# Technically speaking, finding invisible monsters using s is a
# spoiler; but again, it's relatively obvious.
%Cm - 00213
Tutorial: Invisible Monsters

Wait!  There's a monster near you that you can't see!  You may have
been blinded, or the monster is hidden or even invisible!

Unlike most letters, the letter I is special: it shows where you felt
a nearby unseen monster.  If you think it's still there, you can fight
this space by walking into it as usual, but it may have moved since.

To always fight a spot, press F and the direction.  If you know an
unseen monster has moved from a spot marked I, press m and the
direction to walk there without doing anything else.  You can search
all the spots around you by pressing s, which updates spots marked I.

          s    search all spaces around you
    F <dir>    fight (always) in a direction
    m <dir>    move (always) and only move
%E
%Cm - 00230
Tutorial: Doors and Doorways

Closed doors use the + symbol; open doors are shown as filled blocks.

A closed door can be opened by walking into it, or pressing o and the
direction of the door.  If it resists, try again until it works.  If
it's locked, you can pick or unlock it with items or other means, or
kick it down with Ctrl-D.

Open doors prevent diagonal movement in and out of them.  You can
close doors with o as well.  Closed doors can be useful to shut out
hostile monsters.

         o    open or close a door
    Ctrl-D    kick (e.g. to break down a door)
%E
# OK, technically it's a non-Guidebook spoiler to explain that rooms
# tend to be light and corridors tend to be dark; but I'm willing to
# give that away as a freebie, because it's obvious.
%Cm - 00231
Tutorial: Corridors and Lighting

Early dungeon rooms are usually lit, meaning you can see any space in
it that isn't blocked by something; if they are, you'll still remember
any items, traps and dungeon features you saw.

Corridors are filled gray bocks, while solid rock and unexplored areas
show as blank spaces.  Corridors are dark, so without a means of
lighting them, you'll only see monsters when they're next to you!
%E
# Given the first time the player walks to a location where they could
# find a secret by searching. The mention of dead-ends is a non-
# Guidebook
%Cm - 00232
Tutorial: Secret Doors and Corridors

Not all is as it seems in the Mazes of Menace.  Doors, corridors and
other things may be hidden, masquerading as normal rock or wall until
it's discovered.  Press s to search all the spaces around you for such
hidden features.

It can take many tries to reveal a secret door or corridor, and if
nothing is there, you can waste a lot of time.  Good places to search
are dead-end corridors and along the bounds of any place that is
unexplored but looks unreachable.

Now press s to search around here, because there is a secret door or
corridor next to you right now.  You'll need to keep searching until
you find it; each attempt takes time.

        s    search all spaces around you
%E
# The guidebook's basically silent on this. So, this is my attempt
# to describe what happens without spoiling anything too important.
%Cm - 00233
Tutorial: Water

Water (shown as blue wavy lines) is yet another hazard you may face.

Generally, adventurers won't be able to cross large bodies of water
without magical aid, though sometimes it's possible to move carefully
through a swamp by avoiding water spaces (diagonal movement helps).

Be careful around water; falling in can cause a lot of problems,
though you normally won't drown unless you're so burdened you can't
climb back out.  It may be easier to go another route and avoid the
water entirely.
%E
# And it has even less to say about lava...
%Cm - 00234
Tutorial: Lava

Lava (shown as red wavy lines) is an even bigger hazard than water:
few character have the magical protection needed to survive its
blistering heat.

WALKING INTO LAVA CAN BE INSTANTLY FATAL!  The game will NOT confirm
your decision to walk into lava!

DynaHack is turn-based, so if you can't avoid the lava, walk slowly
and carefully around it.  Many a player has lost a promising character
to a lava mistake!
%E
%Cm - 00235
Tutorial: Stairs

Generally, dungeon levels have stairs leading up (the < symbol) and
down (the > symbol).  Use them by standing on them and pressing the
matching key.

If you can't find the stairs forward in a level, you may want to look
for secret doors and corridors (see Secret Doors and Corridors).
Much, much later, some special levels may not have stairs forward at
all, requiring you to do something different to progress.

        <    go up stairs
        >    go down stairs
%E
%Cm - 00236
Tutorial: Fountains

That spout-like symbol (or { symbol) is a fountain.  You can walk past
one, but you can also quaff (drink) from one by standing over it and
pressing q, or dip something into it with the #dip command.

        q    quaff (drink) a potion or from a water source
     #dip    dip something into a potion or fountain

Not all fountains are as they seem!
%E
%Cm - 00237
Tutorial: Thrones

The \ (backslash) symbol is an opulent throne.  You can sit on it by
standing over it and using the #sit command.  If items are on it,
you'll need to clear them off first.

     #sit    sit on whatever is under you
%E
%Cm - 00238
Tutorial: Kitchen Sinks

The # symbol is a sink.  They don't have many obvious uses, but you
can quaff (drink) from one if you feel brave.

        q    quaff (drink) a potion or from a water source
%E
%Cm - 00239
Tutorial: Graves

The cross symbol is a grave, usually of a former adventurer.  If they
died recently, their ghost and possessions will likely be present too,
as well as whatever killed them!

Graves often have buried loot, and can be robbed if you have a means
of digging; just aim downwards on the grave.  Beware, the ghost it
belongs to won't take too kindly to your grave-robbery.

The possessions of dead adventurers are often cursed, so be careful of
how you use what you loot.
%E
# Non-guidebook hints about what sacrifice and prayer actually do.
%Cm - 00240
Tutorial: Altars

The omega symbol (or _ symbol) is an altar, usually dedicated to a
god.  If you're standing on one and want a description of what god and
alignment it is, press : (like ; for things under you).

As a reminder: your %G is %d, as you are %a.

One use of an altar is to sacrifice the corpse of a monster.  To do
this, stand on the altar with the corpse (carried or on the ground)
and use the #sacrifice command.  If your %G is not offended by
your sacrifice, this will have a pleasing effect; sometimes you will
even receive a gift from them.

You can also pray with the #pray command.  This is considered a plea
for help, and deities don't like being pestered too often, so you'll
often want to save it for when your life is in danger.  Prayer is more
effective when standing over your own %G's altar.

        :    describe your position (like ; for things under you)
    #pray    request divine intervention (e.g. on an altar)
%E
%Cm - 00241
Tutorial: Drawbridges

The # symbol is a drawbridge, and acts like a big door, but they tend
to have a more complicated mechanism for opening and closing them.

Drawbridges open over the space in front of them, letting you walk
across.  But beware, for you don't want to be on a drawbridge if it
gets destroyed!
%E
%Cm - 00242
Tutorial: Traps

The ^ symbol is a trap.  Traps have a variety of effects, most of them
bad, so you'll want to avoid them.  You can look at a trap find out
what type it is.

Some traps can be disarmed with the #untrap command while standing
next to them.  This not only removes the trap, but may let you take
its parts.  Beware, a clumsy adventurer may trigger the trap in the
attempt!  #untrap can also check chests and doors for traps, but not
perfectly.

Walking around a trap is ideal, but if you can't and you can't disarm
it, there are often other ways to avoid or disable it.

    #untrap    disarm a trap
%E
%Cm - 00259
Tutorial: Escaping the Dungeon

The < symbol is a stairway leading up; this one is the one you entered
by.  Using it (with the < key) will walk you out of the dungeon and
end your game.

The aim of the game is to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor for your god,
so leaving early isn't ideal.  However, if you hold the Amulet, using
these stairs will lead you to the glory of your god and winning the
game!

Once you escape the dungeon, you cannot re-enter it; to do so, you
must start a new game with a new character.
%E
%Cm - 00260
Tutorial: Faster Movement (alternate)

Moving a space at a time is useful during combat; but it can be boring
and even dangerous over long distances.  There are several ways to
move in a direction until something happens:

        g <dir>    keep moving in a direction until something happens
                   or the corridor forks

        G <dir>
     Ctrl-<dir>    keep moving in a direction and ignore forks

        M <dir>
    Shift-<dir>    keep moving until you can't, e.g. bumping into a
                   monster or dead end

How aggressively you move is your choice.  Note that these are just
conveniences; they don't save turns.  You can also continue moving a
space at a time for now if you wish.

Tutorial: Automatic Travel

Covering lots of previously-visited dungeon locations can be tedious;
but it's possible to automate it somewhat.

Press _ (auto-travel) to select a location to move to; auto-travel
will try to use the shortest path to move you there.  It won't save
turns, but it's convenient.  Auto-travel stops if it finds something
interesting, like a monster or engraving.

While choosing a location, you can also press a map symbol to quickly
move the cursor to special map locations, e.g. > and < for stairs, +
for doors (press again to cycle) and _ for altars.

south-west south south-east       down     the matching directions.

Diagonal movement is vital; it lets you outrun monsters, walk around
traps, move quickly through diagonal corridors and saves turns.

Tutorial: Repeating Commands (alternate)

Tired of pressing s to search that space?  Not only is it tedious, it
can even be dangerous; holding a key can give monsters free hits on
you before you (as a player) can even react!

A safer and faster way of repeating a command is to enter a number,
followed by the command, e.g. 20s will search all the spaces around
you 20 times.  If a monster approaches, these commands will stop
immediately.

You can also repeat your last command with Ctrl-A, which can be useful
for e.g. opening a stuck door.

       20s    search for 20 turns (example for repeating commands)

Tutorial: Item Prompts

You're about to be asked to choose an item for an action you've chosen
to perform.

Each item has a letter (case matters), so if you want to wear armor
that's labelled q, press q at the prompt to choose it.

You can also press ? for a list of suitable items, e.g. armor when
choosing to wear something, and press * to list all items; useful for
unusual actions like wielding things that aren't weapons or throwing
odd items.

Sometimes - is accepted, meaning no item or bare hands.
%E
%Cm - 00268
Tutorial: Unequipping Multiple Items

Equipment can be taken off one item at a time, but there's a less
tedious way.

Pressing A lets you take off armor and jewelry, unwield weapons and
empty your quiver in a single command.  This takes no fewer turns than
entering the commands one by one, but it can be convenient.

Tutorial: Naming Monsters

When many similar monsters are around, it can be hard to track what's
going on.

You can call a monster a name with the C key; the game will then use
that name to refer to the monster, letting you tell them apart from
one another to e.g. focus on attacking one at a time.

You can't name a monster that already has one, unless you're the one
who gave it that name.

If you call your pet a name, you can track it even if you get
separated and it goes wild.

Tutorial: Dropping Multiple Items

Dropping items one at a time takes a turn per item.  You can drop many
items in one turn by pressing D.  This lets you choose items to drop
in a multiple selection menu, before dropping them all at once.

Controls for multiple selection menus:

        x    drop item x (example)
      10x    drop up to 10 of item x (example)
        .    select all
        -    deselect all
        <    scroll a page up

Tutorial: Quick Inventory

Press i to view your full inventory, rather than just a part of it
with I.  Scroll with the < (up) and > (down) keys.

Tutorial: Secondary Weapons

Characters that often switch their weapons, e.g. a bow and a dagger,
can set one as a secondary weapon while using the other.

To set a secondary weapon, first wield it with w, then press x to swap
it out.  You can now wield your main weapon, and switch between it and
your secondary weapon with x.

Tutorial: Looking at things

You haven't pressed ; in a while.  Looking around is important for
survival; even experienced players use it sometimes to tell dangerous
things from harmless ones.

When using ; to look around, you can use . to select a space, but you
can press : instead to view some flavor text.  Often it's just a
literary quote, but sometimes it holds useful information.

Tutorial: The Quiver

If you're throwing the same weapon or firing the same missile again
and again, you can quiver it, letting you throw or fire an item
without having to choose it repeatedly.

Press Q to set the item to go in your quiver.  Once done, instead of
throwing with t and the letter, use the f key to fire your quivered
item.

In terms of gameplay, firing is the same as throwing except it saves
key strokes.

Tutorial: Objective

If you read the introduction (which few do), your aim is to get the
Amulet of Yendor from deep in the Mazes of Menace (rumor says its
beneath the 20th level, beyond the Valley of the Dead), escape with it
and offer it to your %G %d.  Immortality awaits!

Retrieving the Amulet of Yendor won't be easy.  You must find out
where it is and how to reach it.  Many challenges await you; it's no
small matter of just clearing levels, and you'll likely die many, many
times in the attempt.

For now, stay alive, gather equipment and practice combat.  You'll
want to explore the dungeon, build up your defenses and learn what
will get you killed.  Collect gold, gems and other valuables to add to
your final score.  Aim low for the time being: you're a long way from
the Amulet.

Tutorial: Saving and Quitting

Unlike many other games, death is final in DynaHack.  You cannot
create a save file that can be restored more than once.

However, if you need a break, press S to save and exit for now.  When
you're up for more adventuring, choose your save file from the menu to
resume your adventure.

If you're fed up with your game, use the #quit command to abandon it
forever.  This gives you a higher score than just dying, but you can't
restore an older saved game; like dying, quitting is also final.

You can also quit by leaving the dungeon via the stairs you entered
by.  Doing so without the Amulet of Yendor is considered an escape
from the dungeon, and is also final.

To keep playing after a final end, you must create a new character.

        S    save and exit
    #quit    abandon your game forever

Tutorial: Reviewing Messages

By now, you've likely seen many messages appear at the top of the
screen.  If --More-- appears, press space or enter to acknowledge the
message.

If you miss a message, press Ctrl-P to bring up the message log.

On the other hand, if there are too many messages, press escape at the
--More-- prompt to skip the remaining messages for that turn.  You can
still see them in the message log.

Tutorial: Spellcasting

So far you've probably used melee in combat.  However, most
spellcasters aren't good enough to beat everything in melee.

Spellcasters can, well, cast spells.  To do this, press Z to select a
spell, and a direction (up, down and self are valid choices too).  You
must be lined up with a monster to hit it with most spells.

Casting a spell costs magical power (Pw at the bottom of the screen),
which fills up again over time.  As you become more experienced, this
reserve will grow and let you cast more powerful spells.

For now, press Z and cast Force Bolt at a nearby hostile monster.

Tutorial: Thrown Weapons

Firing on monsters can soften them up or even kill them before they
reach you, causing you to take much less damage in melee.

Press the t key to pick an item to throw at a monster; good weapons
include darts (for throwing) and daggers (can be wielded too).  You
must be lined up with a monster to throw at it.  How well this works
depends on your skill with the weapon.

Even spellcasters may want to throw weapons, to preserve and recharge
their magical power (Pw).

Tutorial: Projectile Weapons

To use a bow, crossbow or sling with ammunition, first wield (w) the
launcher, then throw (t) your ammunition; this fires the ammunition
from the launcher, e.g. arrows from a bow.  How well this works
depends on your weapon skill with the launcher.

Don't forget to switch back to a melee weapon after firing; hitting a
monster with a bow isn't very effective.  Consider switching back just
before the monster closes on you, rather than getting one last shot.

Tutorial: Engraving "Elbereth"

As you descend, monsters will get ever more dangerous, and if you
aren't careful you can easily be overwhelmed.  However, there is a way
to get some breathing space in such a situation.

The name "Elbereth" is feared by many creatures, so writing it in the
ground (press E to engrave) with your fingers (choose -) or a wand
will cause monsters to flee in terror for a while.  Used correctly, it
can save your life.

This has many drawbacks.  Writing in the dust is not guaranteed to
come out right.  Fighting on dust will scuff it very quickly, and even
standing on it slowly erodes it.  It won't scare monsters that aren't
next to you, leaving you open at range.  Finally, some monsters just
aren't scared of it.

        E    engrave (write) on the ground
             (E- writes in the dust with your fingers)

If you want a challenge, you can disable Elbereth as a birth option.

Tutorial: More about Melee

When fighting monsters in melee, you hit with whatever you wield in
your hands.  Some weapons work better than others; long swords are
better than daggers.  However, if you aren't skilled with a
weapon, they'll have a hard time hitting with it without practice.
You can view your skills with the #enhance command.

Your attributes (shown at the bottom of the screen) effect how good
you are in melee, and higher is better.  Dexterity (Dex:) lets you hit
more often than miss, especially at range, while strength (Str:) helps
you hit with heavier weapons and deal more damage when you do.

Tutorial: Gold  ('$')

Gold is shown as the $ symbol.  It takes no space in your inventory,
and is light, but not weightless.  You can see how much gold you carry
openly at the bottom of the screen.

Gold adds to your score, but it can also be used to trade in shops
within the dungeon, and negotiate with certain creatures.

You can find out how much gold you carry and how much you owe
shopkeepers with the $ key.

Tutorial: Weapons  (')')

The ) symbol or closing parenthesis is a weapon or ammunition.

The most common way of using a weapon is to wield it with the w key.
With the #enhance command, you can see if your character is good with
the weapon ('basic' or higher), needs practice ('unskilled') or can't
learn how to use it at all.  Without basic skill in a weapon, your
character will have a very hard time hitting with it.

Weapons can also be thrown by pressing the t key (good with darts and
daggers, you can only hit a monster when lined up), or applied with
the a key to hit a target two spaces away if it's long enough, e.g. a
lance.  You can scratch into the floor with a weapon, but this takes a
long time and can damage it, so it's often a bad idea.

Tutorial: Armor  ('[')

A [ symbol is a piece of armor.  Armor protects you from the blows of
your enemies.

Armor can be worn with W and taken off with T.  When worn, most armor
will reveal themselves to be average (+0); some may be better (+1 and
up) or worse (-1 and down).  Elven armor is light and strong, dwarvish
is heavy but sturdier, but orcish is inferior and heavy.

Tutorial: Food  ('%%')

The %% symbol is an edible item (or comestible).  Food can be eaten
with the e key.  Food is needed to live; a character that goes without
eating will grow hungry, then weak, then eventually faint and die of
starvation.

While some comestibles will last forever, many will spoil over time.
Eating very old food can be very dangerous to your health.  Sometimes,
even good food will be a bit spoiled, though never to toxic levels.

Note that killing monsters may leave a %% behind; the monster's
corpse.  They spoil fast, but can be eaten by standing over it and
pressing e.  Some are always bad to eat, but others may grant special
powers.  As they say, you are what you eat.

Tutorial: Scrolls  ('?')

The ? symbol is a scroll.  A scroll is a spell bound to paper.

Press r to read a scroll; doing this will release its magic and use up
the scroll.  Scrolls can be used by anyone and don't rely on
spellcasting skill.

Beware!  Reading an unknown scroll can be very dangerous!  If you can
find out what they do, they can be very useful.  In fact, one common
scroll can identify other items; if you can tell this scroll from
others, your discovery will serve you well.

Tutorial: Wands  ('/')

The / symbol is a wand.  Wands can be zapped to release the spell
within by pressing the z key.  No spellcasting skill is needed to use
them, and they can be used as long as they have charges.  Wands can
also be engraved with (press E), or even broken in an emergency (apply
with a), affecting all around you.

If you can find a wand's charges, it will be shown, as well as how
many times it has been recharged, e.g. (3:5) denotes a wand recharged
3 times with 5 charges left.  Beware!  A wand charged many times may
explode when recharged!

Tutorial: Rings  ('=')

The = symbol is a ring.  Rings grant magical powers when worn (with
the W key) on either of your ring fingers (so you can wear at most two
at a time; take them off with the T key).  Beware!  Not all rings are
good to wear.

Rings are powered by the body of the wearer, so wearing rings will
make you hungrier somewhat faster; very powerful rings speed this up
dramatically!

Tutorial: Potions  ('!')

The ! symbol is a potion, which can be quaffed (drunk) for magical
effects by pressing the q key.  Items can be dipped into potions with
the #dip command, and they can even be thrown with the t key.

Many items, potions especially, have different effects when blessed or
cursed.  Drinking a cursed potion is nearly always a bad idea!

Clear potions are always water.  If blessed or cursed, it is holy or
unholy water.  Holy water can harm the undead, but both have other
uses to be discovered.

Tutorial: Tools  ('(')

The ( is a tool.  There are many tools with different uses, but
generally they can all be applied (used) by pressing the a key.  Some
tools can even be wielded like weapons with the w key!

Some tools are magical but look like mundane ones; there are ways to
tell them apart.

Though some tools can be used without limit, others may have charges
that are consumed each use, or over time while activated (e.g.
lanterns).  If these charges can be seen, they'll be shown along with
the number of times it has been recharged, e.g. (3:5) denotes a tool
recharged 3 times with 5 charges left.  Unlike wands, most (but not
all) tools don't explode when recharged many times.

Tutorial: Containers  ('(')

Containers are special tools and as such are shown as the ( symbol.
To put in or take out items from a container, use the #loot command
while standing over it, or press the a key while holding it.

If you can find a container light enough to carry, you can get around
the limit of 52 items in your inventory.

Containers can be locked or trapped.  A locked container can be
unlocked with certain tools, forced open with your wielded weapon
using the #force command, or even kicked open with Ctrl-D.  To check
for and possibly disarm traps, use the #untrap command over a
container; beware, this may backfire!

          a    apply an item (e.g. a carried container)
      #loot    apply a container on the ground

Tutorial: Amulets  ('"')

The " symbol is an amulet.  Amulets grant magical powers when worn
around your neck (with the W key; take them off with the T key).
Beware!  Not all amulets are good to wear.

Amulets are powered by the body of the wearer, so wearing an amulet
will make you hungrier somewhat faster than usual.

Your quest is to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor from deep in the Mazes
of Menace.  Good luck!

Tutorial: Gems and Rocks  ('*')

The * symbol is a gem or rock; some are valuable, others are not.

Unlike many other items, two gems of the same color may not be the
same gem.  Also, gems sell very poorly unless they are properly
identified.  Nonetheless, gems are light and valuable ones add greatly
to your final score.

There aren't many uses for gems and rocks, but they can be thrown with
the t key, or even fired to do more damage if you wield a sling (this
is best done with rocks, not gems).  They can also be rubbed against
other items with the #rub command for whatever effect that may have.

     #rub    rub items together (e.g. a gem and something else)

%Cm - 00312
Tutorial: Statues and Boulders  ('`' and '0')

The ` symbol is a statue.  Some hold surprises, but most are heavy and
useless.  You can walk past them or break them if you have a way.

The 0 is a boulder.  They can be pushed, but not walked past or lifted
except by the largest of creatures.  If one blocks your path, you can
destroy it if you have the means.  If it gets stuck and you need to
get past it, you can also squeeze into its space by dropping your
items and moving into it.
%E
%Cm - 00313
Tutorial: Spellbooks  ('+')

The + symbol is a book (when it's not a door), usually a spellbook.
Reading one with the r key attempts to learn the spell within; this is
how spells are learned.  Beware!  Reading a spellbook whose power
exceeds your intelligence can be very harmful!

Memory of a spell fades over time; reading a book refreshes it.  This
action also releases magic from the book, so it can only be read a
limited number of times before being spent.

Once a spell has been learned, they can be cast with the Z key, or
listed and rearranged with the + key.  Low-level spells are easier to
learn and cast, and need less power than higher-level ones.  Some
kinds of spells can be cast by your character easier than others;
spell skills can be seen and enhanced with the #enhance command.

           r    read an item (e.g. a spellbook)

Tutorial: Calling Items

You are about to be asked to note what you think of a certain kind of
item, likely due to seeing the effects of one used or destroyed.

You will see hints of what items might be based on what they do during
your adventure.  Noting things you figure out this way with the kind
of item is a key survival skill for all players, even the experienced.

For example: if you saw an orange potion break and its effects, you
may be prompted to "Call an orange potion:".  If you think it was
dangerous, you could enter "dangerous", and from then on, "orange
potion" would be called "potion called dangerous", which you could
avoid quaffing in the future.

If you don't know what to enter, you can leave the prompt blank, and
you'll be given chances to call it later.  Items can also be called at
any time with the C key.

        C    call (name) items, kinds of items and other things
%E
# Artifacts are only mentioned in the artiwishing-conduct section of
# the Guidebook, but a quick explanation of what they are will

%Cm - 00318
Tutorial: Artifacts

An artifact is a unique item with special powers, crafted of ancient
magic or made by the gods.  They have proper names and cannot be
renamed.

Artifacts work just like normal items, but are enhanced, e.g. an
artifact long sword does much more damage than a normal one.
Artifacts are often imbued with permanent magical effects.

Some artifacts can be called on for a unique, beneficial effect using
the V key to invoke it.  A recently invoked artifact won't listen
again for quite a while, so it's best to save it for when it's needed.

Beware!  Artifacts are picky about who uses them; if you aren't the
kind of person it expects, it will hurt you as you touch or use it!
Be careful of artifacts; as they are widely known, you may want to
look up an artifact by name with the / key.

Tutorial: Random-Appearance Items

Many magical (and some non-magical) items look different across games,
but share a single appearance in any one game.  As such, one of the
goals of your adventure is to try to tell what item does what so you
can use them effectively.  The C key (or #name command) helps here.

To name all items that share an appearance, e.g. all orange potions,
use the C key and pick n at the prompt, then select your
orange potion and type your hint, like "dangerous", which calls all
orange potions "potion called dangerous".

Instead, if you find out something about a single item, e.g. you think
a dagger is cursed, you can name just that one with the #name command,
but picking y at the prompt.  Select the dagger and type "cursed", and
the game will refer to it as "a dagger named cursed".

To view your discoveries, press the \ key.

Tutorial: Gaining Experience Levels

Your character just gained an experience level (XL)!

Gaining levels means more hit points and magical power, faster healing
and power charging, and improved spellcasting.  Characters of certain
races and roles also gain special powers as they grow, like sleep
resistance or extra speed.  Many other things also become better for
you the more experienced you are.

Gaining experience by killing monsters is the main way of gaining
experience levels; monsters will get more powerful the deeper you go,
so it's important to keep up in order to survive.

Tutorial: Ranks

You just gained another level; as a result, your rank (at the bottom

Tutorial: Attributes

One of your attributes just increased!  This improves your abilities,
making you more powerful.

There are six attributes, shown at the bottom of the screen:

Strength     (Str:) Affects melee combat and carrying capacity.
Dexterity    (Dex:) Affects your ability to hit and aim at things.
Constitution (Con:) Affects your ability to sustain injury.
Intelligence (Int:) Affects the power of your spells.
Wisdom       (Wis:) Affects the rate at which you regain magic power.
Charisma     (Cha:) Affects enemy's reactions towards you.

Attributes are hard to change; either you'll need to constantly
exercise them, or find some magical way to push them to higher values.
Some magical equipment can even raise your attributes when worn.
%E
%Cm - 00323
Tutorial: Attribute Abuse

One of your attributes just decreased.  This makes you weaker.

This can happen because of unwise actions, neglecting to train a
certain kind of activity, or the actions of other monsters, e.g.
poison can seriously abuse abilities.

There are six attributes, shown at the bottom of the screen:

Strength     (Str:) Affects melee combat and carrying capacity.
Dexterity    (Dex:) Affects your ability to hit and aim at things.
Constitution (Con:) Affects your ability to sustain injury.
Intelligence (Int:) Affects the power of your spells.
Wisdom       (Wis:) Affects the rate at which you regain magic power.
Charisma     (Cha:) Affects enemy's reactions towards you.

Tutorial: Going Deeper

Welcome to a deeper level of the dungeon!  As you descend the dungeon,
it will become more dangerous; expect stronger monsters, deadlier
traps and new hazards.

If you leave a level, you can still return to it.  Monsters are
effectively frozen when on a different level, but other time passes,
e.g. food will still spoil.  You can return to a level to continue
exploring it and collect items, retreat from something dangerous, come
back to something you can now safely handle or make use of useful
locations.

Your dungeon level (Dlvl:) is shown at the bottom of the screen.  Some
levels may be named instead; this appears in the same place.

Tutorial: Health

Ouch!  You just lost some hit points (HP).  When it falls to zero or
lower, you will die, so if you find a way to restore them quickly, it
will help in emergencies.

Hit points, are shown at the bottom of the screen, e.g. HP:8(10) means
that you have 8 hit points out of a maximum of 10.  Hit points slowly
regenerate over time.

Your constitution (Con:) attribute measures how well you sustain
injury; high constitution gives you more hit points and restores them
faster over time.
%E
%Cm - 00326
Tutorial: Magical Power

You just used (or lost) some magical power (Pw).

Magical power is shown at the bottom of the screen, e.g.  Pw:3(5)
means that you have 3 points of power out of a total of 8.  Power
slowly recharges over time.

Power is spent when casting spells; powerful spells need more magical
power to be used.  If you don't have enough, you cannot cast spells
until you do.

Your wisdom (Wis:) attribute improves your maximum power and rate that
it recharges.  Your intelligence (Int:) also improves the rate that
you recharge power, as well as your ability to learn from spellbooks,
cast spells successfully and makes your spells more powerful.

%Cm - 00327
Tutorial: Alternatives to Magic

Your magic power has run so low that you can't cast spells until it
regenerates!  If your character relies on magic, you may be in
trouble, but you have a few options.

You can retreat to a cleared area of the dungeon to wait for your
power to regenerate.

You can let your pet do your fighting for a while; moving around it or
swapping places to put it between you and any monsters.

You can also try fighting yourself; most spellcasters should practice
and improve their skill in a weapon so they can fight in melee if they
must; thrown or projectile weapons can also weaken monsters at range
and conserve power.  Without practice, you'll find it hard to hit when
you run out of power again and you really need it.
%E
%Cm - 00328
Tutorial: Using Armor

Your Armor Class (AC) has just reduced; unlike most stats, this is a
good thing, as it improves your protection against incoming attacks.

Lower AC helps you avoid attacks, and negative AC will even absorb
damage when you are hit anyway.

Wearing armor has drawbacks.  A lot of armor is heavy, reducing how
much you can carry and still move quickly.  Metallic armors impede
your body's magical flow and shields make the hand movements needed
for spellcasting clumsier, lowering your chance to cast correctly.
Shields use a hand that could be used for a weapon.  Finally, some
magical items can only be equipped in certain ways, making you choose
between AC and its magical protection.

Early in the game, the benefits of armor almost always outweigh these
drawbacks.  Even wizards can use some armor!
%E
%Cm - 00329
Tutorial: Experience

You've just gained experience points!  Killing monsters is the most
common way to do this, though many other actions grant a little bit of
it too; a few very skilled players have even won without killing a
single monster!

When you get enough experience points, you will gain an experience
level, which generally makes you stronger.  Early in the game, you'll
want to kill anything you safely can, though later on you may wish to
avoid some monsters.

Pets can gain experience too; if they get the final blow on a monster,
they gain hit points and eventually grow into bigger, more powerful
creatures.  It's up to you how much experience you let your pet get
instead of yourself.

Tutorial: Hunger

You're getting hungry, so now would be a good time to eat something.
Press the e key to eat edible items, i.e. anything with an %% symbol.

When hungry, your hunger status will be shown at the bottom of the
screen ('Hungry', 'Weak' or 'Fainting').  Just being hungry isn't a
problem, but getting too hungry saps your strength and may cause you
to faint, leaving you open to attack.  You may even starve to death!

Food rations and other 'people' food keep indefinitely and can be
eaten with relative safety.  On the other hand, food that doesn't keep
can make you sick or even give you fatal food poisoning!

You can also try eating the corpse of a monster while standing over
it.  An old corpse can be tainted, so beware of eating any corpse you
didn't recently kill.  Some corpses are always bad for you, others
taste "terrible" but won't harm you, and some may even grant special
powers; as they say, you are what you eat.

Tutorial: Satiation

You are 'Satiated' (see the bottom of the screen), meaning you're full
after eating; the opposite of hunger.  Beware!  If you eat too much
more, you may choke on your food and die!

You'll naturally become less satiated and then hungry again over time.
However, if you really want to eat something soon, you can get hungry
faster in a few ways: wear rings and amulets and cast spells (magic
consumes your body's nutrition) or do physically-demanding activities.

Tutorial: Status

You've been hit by a status effect!  Shown at the bottom of the
screen, status effects like confusion or blindness make it hard to act
correctly; some can even kill you, like illness or food poisoning!

If the status isn't fatal, which if often isn't, you can simply wait
in a safe place until it wears off over time.  You can also use items
or spells to cure you.

Eating the corpses of some monsters always afflicts you with a status
effect; experiment across games to find out which ones to avoid.

If your life is in danger with no easy way to cure yourself, you can
use the #pray command to ask for divine intervention, but beware, for
deities don't like being bothered too often.

    #pray    request divine intervention

Tutorial: Enhancing Skills

Once you practice enough in combat, weapons or magic, you will "feel
more confident in your skills", meaning you can choose to enhance a
skill.  Use the #enhance command to select a skill to enhance.

You are limited in how many skills you can advance, and how high.  You
have a number of 'skill slots' equal to your experience level, and the
higher a skill advances, the more slots it needs; you may want to hold
back on advancing too many different skills if there's one you want to
advance very high.  Also, a skill you want later should be trained
early so you can make good use of it in time.

Only skills in shown in the list can be advanced at all; some
characters may never be able to use certain skills effectively.  The
highest that skills can be advanced depends on your character's role.

Tutorial: Polymorph

You've transformed (or polymorphed) into a monster!  Monsters have
strengths and weaknesses quite different from your own, and may not
even be able to do things you've taken for granted like open doors.

Some monsters have a special ability, which you'll told when you
change form.  Often, this is a monster ability, which can be used by
pressing M key (or using the #monster command).

Female monsters may be able to lay eggs by using the #sit command.

        M    (or #monster) use the special ability of a monster
     #sit    sit on whatever is under you (e.g. to lay an egg)

# Wands are shown in-game in the "plausible items" list for engraving;
# so I think it's not a spoiler to mention that you can engrave with
# them, although it /is/ a spoiler to mention what happens when you do.
%Cm - 00335
Tutorial: Engravings

There's something written on the space you've stepped on.  If you're
standing on it and don't care to look through your previous messages,
you can read it again by pressing the : key.

You can write on the floor yourself using the E key to engrave.  You
can type E- to write in the dust with your fingers, but what you write
won't last long.  You can scratch into the floor with a hard item or
weapon, but note that this dulls the weapon.  Some magical wands can
also be used for writing.

Tutorial: Prayer

You're in serious trouble!  If you're badly hurt, starving, have both
hand welded to a cursed weapon or suffer from something equally bad,
you can pray to your %G with the #pray command.

If you've been careful not to offend them and have advanced the cause
of your religion (killing monsters works), they may help you from your
predicament.

Deities don't like being bothered too often, so prayer is usually
reserved for emergencies.  However, it can have beneficial effects
too, so if you want to pray again soon, you can appease your %G
with suitable offerings at their altar with the #sacrifice command.

         #pray    request divine intervention
    #sacrifice    offer something to a deity at an altar

Tutorial: Encumbrance

You are carrying so much weight that you are now encumbered!  To
unencumber yourself, drop items with the d key until you can move
freely again; you can always come back for them later.

As you carry more and more, you'll become "Burdened" (at the bottom of
the screen), then "Stressed", "Strained" and "Overtaxed" up to
"Overloaded".  The more encumbered you are, the slower you'll move
relative to enemies, and the harder it will be to move up or down
stairs or even at all.

Your strength (Str:) and constitution (Con:) attributes determine how
much you carry before you become encumbered; higher values let you
carry more weight.

Now try dropping a few items with the d key.

        d    drop a single item
%E
%Cm - 00338
Tutorial: Curses

You have found a cursed item.

Cursed items are often less effective and sometimes more dangerous to
you.  They tend to stick too: cursed weapons weld to your hands when
wielded, and cursed armors and equipment stick to your body when worn.
You usually need to lift the curse with by some magical means to get
rid of the item.

Blessed items are the opposite of cursed, and tend to be more
effective, or in the case of bad items, less dangerous to you.  An
item neither blessed nor cursed is said to be uncursed.

Blessed water is holy and cursed is unholy, which can be very useful.

Items in your inventory will be marked as blessed or cursed if you
know for sure.  Most objects will be uncursed if you know it, which
may also be marked depending on the show_uncursed option.

# DynaHack lacks mail (SCR_MAIL) for now.
%Cm - 00339
Tutorial: MAIL

You've got mail!  If someone sends you a message, a mail daemon will
turn up and give it to you; it'll appear in the form of a scroll, and
reading the scroll will allow you to check what the message was.  The
form of the message will depend on where and how you're playing; if
you're on your own computer, then the scroll will normally be a
response to the receipt of email, in which case you can read the
scroll to read the email; but when playing on a public DynaHack
server, the mail will probably be related to your game, sent by
someone watching.  In this case, you can effectively send a reply by
pressing #, then space, then typing in your message and leaving it on
the screen for a while; whoever's watching your game (and sent the
mail) will be able to read the response on your screen.

If you get fed up of being sent mail all the time, you can turn this
option off, by using O to enter the options screen, and turning off
the 'mail' option.

Tutorial: Spellcasting and Armor

Each spell you cast may have a chance to fail.  Higher-level spells
are harder to cast correctly than lower-level ones.

In general, metal armor blocks magic, and shields obstruct the complex
hand motions needed to cast spells, so wearing either of those will
increase the failure rate of spells.  You can the failure rates of
each spell when you cast it (Z) or view the list of known spells (+).

If you're very good with magic, you may have a failure rate of 0%% for
some spells even when wearing metal armor or a shield; if those spells
are all you need, wearing armor may be worth the trade-off.  Later on,
you may want to cast higher-level spells, and so either swap out your
armor for non-metallic armor or ditch it altogether.

If you're not good with magic, you can choose to just ignore it
entirely and wear whatever you please.

Tutorial: Weapon Choice

You've just wielded a weapon your character isn't very good with.
They'll have a hard time hitting and will do less damage when they do.

Use the #enhance command to find out what weapons your character is
good with ('basic' or higher), needs practice with ('unskilled') or
can't learn at all (unlisted).

If you really want to use a different weapon your character is not
good with, you can practice against weaker monsters until it's
possible to raise it through the #enhance command.

Now, you can choose to keep using this weapon, or switch back to a
weapon your character is more comfortable with.

Tutorial: Engulfed

You've been engulfed by a monster!  Some monsters choose to engulf,
swallow or absorb their prey whole instead of fighting the usual ways.
Now you must fight your way out from inside.

While engulfed, attacks, spells and other actions will all affect your
engulfing foe, and you'll always hit while within it.  Zapping wands
can help you escape too.

Generally, you'll want to escape quickly; many monsters can do a lot
of damage to you while they engulf you, and some of the more dangerous
ones can even fatally digest you!

Tutorial: Death

Congratulations!  You are now dead; looks like someone else will have
to get that Amulet.

Death is final, so you can't restore your character from an older save
file.  You'll need to start again with a new character to play again.

When you die, your final score is calculated, based mostly on the
treasure you had and the monsters you killed.  You may even make the
high score list!  You're told what items you had, so you can figure
out what you did wrong.

If you keep dying, you can play in 'explore mode' to avert death by
using the #exploremode command, but preventing your score from being
added to the high score list.  Beware!  Once you enter explore mode,
your character cannot return to a normal scoring game.  Once you've got
the ropes, return to win in normal mode; explore mode wins don't count!

    #exploremode    enter non-scoring invincible explore mode

Tutorial: Shopping

The dungeon houses a number of hardy shopkeepers who have decided to
sell their wares to foolish adventurers such as y... somebody else.

Except for the space inside the door, items in the shop belong to and
are sold by the shopkeeper.

To buy something, pick it up and pay the shopkeeper with the p key to
make it yours.  To sell something, drop it (with the d or D keys), and
the shopkeeper will offer to buy it for a price (if you decline, just
pick the item back up).

        p    pay for items
        d    drop a single item (e.g. to sell it)
        D    drop many items (e.g. to sell them)
%E
%Cm - 00361
Tutorial: Purchasing Items

You now hold one of the shopkeepers items.  Careful, if you break or
use it, the shopkeeper will demand you pay for it.

You can now pay for the item by pressing the p key.  The shopkeeper
will take your money (if you have enough), and the item becomes yours.

To find out how much you owe, chat to the shopkeeper with the c key
while not standing over an item, or press the $ key to view it as well
as the money you hold.  You can find the price of an item just by
looking at it, or standing over it and chatting to the shopkeeper with
the c key.

Your charisma (Cha:) attribute determines the prices the shopkeeper
gives you when buying and selling; high values get you better prices
both ways.

        p    pay for items
        c    chat to an adjacent creature (e.g. shopkeeper)

# Branches and special levels. The three mentioned here (the Mines,
# Sokoban, and the Oracle) are all mentioned in the Guidebook.
%Cm - 00362
Tutorial: The Gnomish Mines

It's long been rumored that the gnomes built a mine complex somewhere
in the dungeons, and it looks like you just found it.

There are several side-branches to the main dungeon, of which the
Mines are the first.  Though branches are mostly optional, they can be
rewarding.  (What adventurer wouldn't want to explore a working gem
mine?)

In general, levels only have two sets of stairs (one going up, one
going down); but the entries to branches are different, having another
set that leads to the branch, e.g. the level before the Mines has
stairs leading to the Mines, and stairs continuing along the main
dungeon.

The ends of branches are also special; eventually, if you explore to
the bottom of the Mines, you'll hit a dead end with no stairs down.
Most players do choose to (now or later) explore side branches that
they find; the riches to be found are often just like or better than
those in the main dungeon.
%E
%Cm - 00363
Tutorial: Sokoban

Welcome to a dungeon side-branch!  Though mostly optional, dungeon
branches reward exploration, even if they lead to dead ends.

You have entered Sokoban, an odd area of the dungeon with boulder
puzzles.  Your aim here is to push to boulders into the pits and
holes, moving boulders only cardinally and not slipping between
them.  The layout of the level is revealed to help you do this.

You can solve every puzzle with the traditional Sokoban rules, but you
can get yourself out of a mess with anything at your disposal.  Be
careful if you do this; cheaters will find themselves in bad luck.
You can't undo your moves, so think carefully before moving any
boulders!
%E
# What the oracle does is not a Guidebook spoiler, but is obvious.
%Cm - 00364
Tutorial: The Oracle

Welcome to the Oracle!  Although most of the levels in the dungeon are
generated at random, some have predetermined areas, or are unusual in
other ways; for instance, the Oracle of Delphi has a specially
designed room all to herself, from which she makes prophecies.

You can chat to the Oracle using the c key; she'll be willing to give
you advice in return for money.  The Oracle's consultations are full
of useful, if obscure, information about the game; you can gain a lot
of information this way.

There are more 'special levels' deeper in the dungeon; but you'll have
to figure out how those ones work yourself.
