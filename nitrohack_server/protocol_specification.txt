DynaHack Network Protocol v1
============================

0) Basics
---------
The protocol is based on JSON. Each client command and each server response is
a single, valid JSON object in UTF8 encoding.


1) Interaction
--------------
Once the client has connected to the server, it must send either an *auth*  or
a *register* command. If the client sends a successful register command, a
following *auth* command is not necessary.

When the client is authenticated any other command may be sent to the server.

2) Client commands
------------------

*auth*:    Authenticate the client with the server. Parameters: "username" is a
           valid UTF8 string, which no more than 50 multibyte characters long.
           The server may impose additional restrictions regarding forbidden
           characters. "password" is an arbitrary sequence of bytes of any
           length.
           The total length of a JSON-encoded *auth* command may not exceed 500
           bytes.
           Example:  {"auth" : {"username" : "a name", "password" : "p4ssw0rd"}}

*register* Register a new user on the server. Like the *auth* command, but there
           is an additional optional parameter "email". If given, it specifies
           an email address for password resets.
           Like *auth* the total command length may not be greater than 500 bytes.
